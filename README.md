This is an exercise in architecture focussing on Domain Driven Design an microservices. The app has no real purpose. 

It's structured as a monorepo:

-   [**core**](./core) are my DDD core classes
-   [**users-service**](./users-service) is going to be an authentication service

## Resources

The Domain Driven Design architecture is heavily inspired by [Khalil Stemmlers excellent blog](https://khalilstemmler.com/).

The microservice architecture is heavily inspired by [Better Coding Academy's excellent video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gD-WutJH0qc&list=PLnTRniWXnjf8YC9qJFLSVCrXfS6cyj6x6)
